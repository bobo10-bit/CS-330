What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
From the work on the project I was able to learn new design skills such as creating different 3d objects, texture them, create custom lighting, and adding colors to the 3d objects. For this project I did milestones that created a part of the project such as adding lighting on one milestone or creating the shapes in another. By working on the project I had to read and learn how to do the various skills and implement them into my project.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
When designing my project I first looked for various object I had and looked for objects that were made of various basic shapes. After that I had to do various milestones that added a feature to the project. First I read the resources provided to me on each milestone. Then I went to the section that needed editing to add the feature in. While adding in the features if I needed more help or got an error I would search a solution to the error and tried running the project. After that I moved on to the next milestone until each section was done and the project was finished.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
These tactics can be applied in my future works to help create a structure to complete each project. by following these tactics I can have my structure which is read the material and requirements of the projects. Then code and bug check the requirement until the project is complete.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Some development strategies I used are to run the program often, make sure to read over the code, and to learn the material fully before working on the project. By running the program often I was able to find bugs early on and check if the part I implemented worked or not. By reading over the code I was able to find spelling errors and bugs I created. By learning the material fully before working on the project I was able to create less bugs then if I started working on the project without understanding the material completly.

How did iteration factor into your development?
For this project I used a basic cycle of reading the materials working on the project then fixing any errors on the project and turning it in. I had to do many cycles of this because the project was split with milestones so when doing each milestone I had to do my basic cycle until my project was complete.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
During the development of my project I tried new approches to developing the code such as looking over the comment section of the project to understand what each section does and learning how to add each new section into the existing code. By reading over the comments I was able to understand what each section of the code did and was able to quickly change it so that I can add in the new features.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
computational graphics and visualizations can by applied in my future educational pathway by allowing me to use it for future classes. If I take another class that requires knowledge about openGL I can use the knowledge I learned from this classes to implement onto my future classes.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Computational graphics and visualization can be applied in my future professional pathway by helping my understand it for game developement. In the future I would like to learn about game developement and this course teached me a lot of how objects are created and how textures and lights are created and applied in 3d scenes.
